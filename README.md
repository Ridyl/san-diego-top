Enjoyed doing this project and bonus challenges. Went a little off the original challenges because I wanted to use leafletJS instead 
of the Google API and thouroughly enjoyed learning how to implement it. There are things that I want to come back to in the future for
this project, but for now it is completely functional as a little "Top Hits" list.

Things I want to add in the future:
  -A way to create a route from any input address.
  -Sort from closest to farthest based on the address, or sort based on reviews.
  -Style the page a little more to make it more interesting to look at and add
   animations for the map to make it slide down and up.
